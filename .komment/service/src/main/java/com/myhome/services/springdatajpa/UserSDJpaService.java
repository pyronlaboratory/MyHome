Handles user account creation, modification, and deletion through methods like createUser(), updateUser(), and deleteUser().\n2. Provides a method to find a user by their ID or email address, as well as a method to find all users in the system.\n3. Offers a method to reset a user's password using a forgotten password request, and a method to confirm an email address for a user.\n4. Utilizes Spring Security's token-based authentication and authorization features through methods like createPasswordResetToken(), useToken(), and

above example, a method named `encryptUserPassword` takes in a parameter of type UserDto and sets the encrypted password field of that object using the encode method from the PasswordEncoder interface, which is implemented by the BCryptPasswordEncoder.
