The interface includes three methods: `houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseHouseMemberSet`, `houseMemberDtoSetToHouseMemberSet`, and `houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseAddHouse MemberSet`. These methods allow for the conversion of sets of `HouseMember` objects to/from sets of `HouseMemberDto` objects, as well as the addition of new `HouseMember` objects to an existing set. The code uses Mapstruct, a high-level package for mapping one data structure to another, to perform these mappings.","items":[{"id":"b451a0e4-76ec-5db9-2449-faf746856501","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"defines three methods for mapping between HouseMember and HouseMemberDto entities and their corresponding REST API responses.","name":"HouseMemberMapper","code":"@Mapper\npublic interface HouseMemberMapper {\n  Set<com.myhome.model.HouseMember> houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseHouseMemberSet(\n      Set<HouseMember> houseMemberSet);\n\n  Set<HouseMember> houseMemberDtoSetToHouseMemberSet(Set<HouseMemberDto> houseMemberDtoSet);\n\n  Set<com.myhome.model.HouseMember> houseMemberSetToRestApiResponseAddHouseMemberSet(\n      Set<HouseMember> houseMemberSet);\n}","location":{"start":24,"insert":24,"offset":" ","indent":0},"item_type":"interface","length":10}]}}}
