The method `contextLoads()` is also annotated with `@Test`, indicating that it should be run as a test case. The body of the method contains a comment, indicating that the test should pass if the context loads correctly.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to write and run a unit test for a Spring Boot application using JUnit Jupiter. It is a simple example that verifies that the context can be loaded, but you could replace this with any other relevant test code based on your specific needs."},"name":"contextLoads","code":"@Test\n  void contextLoads() {\n  }","location":{"start":25,"insert":25,"offset":" ","indent":2,"comment":null},"item_type":"method","length":3}]}}}
