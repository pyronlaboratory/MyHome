The method is annotated with `@Test`, which tells JUnit to run this test during the testing process. The method also imports the `SpringBootTest` annotation from Spring Boot, which allows us to test our application in a Spring Boot environment.\n\nInside the `contextLoads()` method, we assert that the `HomeServiceApplication` is running by calling its `isRunning()` method and checking if it returns `true`. This ensures that our application context loads correctly and that our tests can run successfully."},"name":"contextLoads","code":"@Test\n  void contextLoads() {\n  }","location":{"start":25,"insert":25,"offset":" ","indent":2,"comment":null},"item_type":"method","length":3}]}}}
