The class has a constructor that takes in a HouseService and a HouseApiMapper object, which are used to interact with a housing service and map request bodies to response objects. The class has two methods: status() and listAllHouses(). The listAllHouses() method takes in a ListAllHouseRequestBody object as a request body and uses the HouseService and HouseApiMapper objects to find all houses and map them to a ListAllHouseResponse object, which is then returned in the response.","items":[{"id":"65aa3062-be10-c4b9-5643-67f15eb8cc2a","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"TODO","name":"HouseController","code":"@RestController\n@Slf4j\npublic class
