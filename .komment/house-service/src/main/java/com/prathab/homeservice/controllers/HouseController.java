The controller uses the Spring WebFlux framework and depends on several packages, including Lombok, Slf4j, Spring Web Flux, and Apache Commons Lang.\nThe code defines two methods: `status()` and `listAllHouses()`. In `listAllHouses()`, a request body is used to send a request to the HouseService, which returns a list of houses. The response is then converted into a ListAllHouseResponse object using a HouseApiMapper class before being returned as a ResponseEntity with an HTTP status code of 200.","items":[{"id":"88794980-33e9-8396-544d-f8d33f9be2c4","ancestors":[],"type":"function","description":"is a Spring RESTful controller that handles requests related to houses.
